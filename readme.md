## üìä Match Scoring Algorithm

ResuMatch uses a sophisticated algorithm to calculate match scores:

1. **Skill Extraction**: Identifies both single-word skills (e.g., "Python", "React") and multi-word skills (e.g., "machine learning", "project management")
2. **Proficiency Analysis**: Detects skill levels (beginner, intermediate, advanced)
3. **Summary Relevance**: Analyzes resume summary for keyword matches
4. **Experience Evaluation**: Considers years of experience and leadership roles
5. **Actionable Feedback**: Generates specific suggestions based on missing skills

The final score weighs these factors to provide a realistic assessment of job fit.
